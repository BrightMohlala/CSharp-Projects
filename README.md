C# Projects Portfolio
Welcome to my C# Projects Portfolio, a collection of applications I’ve built as part of my learning journey in Computer Science & Mathematics, software development practice, and personal exploration.
Each project highlights different programming concepts, algorithms, and problem-solving approaches.

Technologies Used
- C# (.NET Framework)
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Windows Forms / WPF (if applicable)
- Console Applications
- LINQ
- File Handling
- Git & GitHub

Projects Included (some of them)
1. A Calculator Program
A simple but efficient console calculator showcasing:
- Arithmetic operations
- Conditional statements
- Clean user-driven menus
Directory: SimpleCalculator/
Concepts: loops, methods, user input validation

2. StudentTracker Program
A mini student record system with:
- Add/Edit/Delete student data
- File-based storage
- Basic validation
Directory: StudentTracker/
Concepts: OOP, file handling, classes & objects

3. Weather Forecast Program 
Fetches live weather data from a prompt and displays:
- Temperature
- Forecast
- Conditions
Directory: Weather Forecast (State)/
Concepts: JSON, async/await

and many other projects...
